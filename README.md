# odin-recipes
First odin project about recipes.

### Introduction
Current project is started and it is about building an odin recipe simple html web page.

### Assignment

Iteration 1: initial structure

1.Within the odin-recipes directory, create an index.html file.
2.Fill it out with the usual boilerplate HTML and add an h1 heading “Odin Recipes” to the body.

Iteration 2: recipe page
Create a new directory within the odin-recipes directory and name it recipes.
Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name it after the recipe it will contain. For example lasagna.html. You can use the name of your favorite dish or, if you need some inspiration, you can find a recipe to use at Allrecipes. Be sure to include the usual boilerplate HTML. This boilerplate code should be in every .html file you create.
For now, just include an h1 heading with the recipe’s name as its content.
Back in the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page you just created. Example: Under the <h1>Odin Recipes</h1> heading, write out the link like so: <a href="recipes/recipename.html">Recipe Title</a>. The text of the link should again be the recipe name.
